--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General framework-wide changes and improvements

   -- Renamed 'Eaagles' namespace to 'oe' to align with project name

   -- Renamed all camelcase-style namespaces to lowercase names - this aligns with
      common C++ conventions and avoids confusion with class names

   -- Renamed 'basic' library to 'base' - 'base' and 'core' are very common names used
      by frameworks to define a base set of functionality provided on top of C++.
      This adjustment is designed to make the framework feel more familiar in that regard.

   -- Renamed 'basicGL' library to 'graphics' - conveys purpose of library better, OpenGL
      is a means, displaying graphics is the intent.

   -- Renamed 'ioDevice' library to 'iodevice' - aligns better with all lowercase
      library names (typically used in Linux universe)

   -- Renamed 'linearSys' library to 'linearsystem' - slightly more clear

   -- Created 'models' libraries, it now includes what used to be in 'dynamics' and
      'sensors' libraries. This is the start of a fundamental effort to separate models
      from simulation infrastructure.

   -- Moved 'dis' directory into 'networks' to group different interoperability
      interfaces into the same logical place.

   -- Added an hla interoperability library to 'networks' directory.

   -- Removed legacy support for 'formnames' in all Object-based classes

   -- form functions and Factory classes in libraries have been replaced with 'factory'
      functions.  This is a bit of a reversal from Factory objects that defined a
      single static method for object creation as is common in the Java world. But then
      again, Java is a pure OO programming language, C++ is a multi-paradigm programming
      language - standalone functions can be defined, so take advantage of it.

   -- Renamed global framework configuration options to start with 'OE' instead
      of 'EAAGLES'

   -- LCreal (which has been hardcoded and typed as 'double' for years) has been completely
      removed and replaced with 'double'

   -- Closely associated with LCreal is the macro "LCREAL_DOUBLE" which defined whether or not
      LCreal was defined as a 'double' or 'float' -- this macro has been eliminated.

   -- Replaced fundamental lc prefixed math macros (e.g., lcSin) with 'std::' equivalents
      (e.g. std::sin) to reduce unnecessary code and improve clarity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base library

   -- previously named the 'basic' library

   -- removed legacy support for factory names "BroadcastHandler", "MulticastHandler",
      and "UdpHandler" - instead use more explicit "UdpBroadcastHandler", "UdpMulticastHandler"
      and "UdpUnicastHandler" factor names.

   -- separated MonitorMetrics class definition and implementation away from Cie.h/cpp file.
   
   -- broke out everything defined by 'support.h/cpp' into groups and placed functionality
      into files located in subdirectory 'util' (i.e., 'utilities').  Object no longer
      imports everything that was defined in 'support.h', classes now include only what is
      needed.
      
   -- almost all 'support.h' functions are now defined in scope of 'base' namespace - no
      longer are they scoped in the broader 'oe' namespace.  The combination of grouping
      functionality into individual related utility files and more explicity including
      them (e.g., #include "openeaagles/base/util/system.h") where needed, results in
      more explicit explict references to them (e.g., base::msleep).  This makes it more
      obvious as to where they are defined, and ensure they are defined only where needed.

   Number class
     -- replaced constructor to handle defined 64-bit 'Integer64' datatype to standard
        64-bit integer 'int64_t'. 'Integer64' was dropped in favor of using 'int64_t'.

   'lc' functions
     -- removed lcMax and lcMin, use std::fmax and std::fmin from <cmath> instead.
        When C++14 becomes better supported, should use std::max and std::min templates
        from <algorithm> library
     -- renamed the 'lc' prefix on all char-based string functions and replaced with
        'ut' to indicate utility and clearly avoid any ambiquity with legacy C functions
        such as 'strcpy', etc.  The prefix was changed to better indicate the nature
        of function (i.e., it's a utility)

   Thread classes
     -- platform specific code associated with the thread classes has been restructured
        to properly include files correctly.  Before, the Thread.cpp file was including
        platform specific class methods into the oe::base namespace.  But the included
        file for linux was including other includes, such as, <signal.h>. So declarations
        were being imported into the oe::base namespace. Surprisingly, no apparent errors
        resulted. Nevertheless the code has been restructured more properly.

dafif library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dis library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
glut library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
graphics library

   -- previously named the 'basicGL' library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hla library

   -- new library - code to support HLA interoperability interface

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
instruments library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iodevice library

   -- previously named the 'ioDevice' library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
linearsystem library

   -- previously named the 'linearSys' library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
models library

   JSBSimModel class
      -- Added new slot parameter ('debugLevel') to set the debug level for JSBSim
         model instance. This controls the verbosity (i.e., output printed to console)
         of the model itself.  Slot parameter accepts an integer value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
otw library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recorder library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rpf library

   -- new library - actually is all the code that was in the 'maps' library. But akin
      to how 'dis' and 'hla' are organized relative to 'networks' directory, this
      is now organized the same way.

   -- rpf = Raster Product Format (RPF) library, it supports the reading of data in
      this format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
simulation library

   Autopilot class
      -- Fixed spelling error with 'velocityContoller' to 'velocityController'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
terrain library
